# A Whirlwind Introduction to Computer Programming

The world runs on computers, but somebody has to tell those computers what to do.
**That person could be you!**

In this course we're going to dive into the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks and [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

Right from the start you will be writing and running code, feeling like you have magical powers to command computers to your every whim.
The end goal is to be able to take simple ideas and translate them into a language that your computer can understand.

**This series is not intended to turn you into a skilled programmer, but rather to introduce core concepts in an approachable (and hopefully fun) way** so that you may feel more comfortable diving into some other [introductory material](#what-next) and have a bit of familiarity. 

No prior knowledge of programming is expected or required, and the only software you should need is the web browser you're using to read this right now.

## Syllabus

### [Introduction to Python](notebooks/01-introduction.ipynb)

Learn about variables, data types, functions, basic input and output, etc.

### [Practice Makes Perfect](notebooks/02-practice.ipynb)

Get the hang of things by combining topics from the previous session in more intricate ways and learning some troubleshooting techniques.

### [Libraries are Our Friends](notebooks/03-libraries.ipynb)

Don't reinvent the wheel.
Learn to take advantage of existing code to do what you need.

### [Interacting with The Internet](notebooks/04-internet.ipynb)

Learn how to access and make the most of interactive information on the Internet.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
You can [click here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cirla/whirlwind/master?filepath=notebooks%2F01-introduction.ipynb) to launch a binder from this repository and jump right into the introduction.

Alternatively, you could use [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/cirla/libraries/whirlwind) or try [installing Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/install) on your own computer.
