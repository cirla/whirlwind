# A Whirlwind Introduction to Computer Programming

The world runs on computers, but somebody has to tell those computers what to do.
That person could be you!
In this course we're going to dive into the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks and [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).
Right from the start you will be writing and running code, feeling like you have magical powers to command computers to your every whim.
The end goal is to be able to take simple ideas and translate them into a language that your computer can understand.
This series is not intended to turn you into a skilled programmer, but rather to introduce core concepts in an approachable (and hopefully fun) way so that you may feel more comfortable diving into some other [introductory material](#what-next) and have a bit of familiarity. 
No prior knowledge of programming is expected or required, and the only software you should need is the web browser you're using to read this right now.
